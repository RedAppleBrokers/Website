    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

    <section>
      <h3>Introduction:</h3>
      <p>We are committed to ensuring your privacy is protected. Please take time to read this document carefully as it contains details of the basis on which we will process (collect, use, share, transfer) and store your information. You should show this notice to all parties related to any service or related insurance arrangement. If you have given us information about someone else, you are deemed to have their permission to do so.</p>
      <p>If you have any questions or need further information you can e-mail <a href="mailto:office@redapplebrokers.co.uk">office@redapplebrokers.co.uk</a> or write to our Data Protection Officer, Office 101, Chambers Business Centre, Unit 2, Chapel Road, OL8 4QQ.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Who we are</h3>
      <p>We are Red Apple Brokers Ltd, company registration number 16697365; we operate as an Insurance Intermediary. We are part of the Jensten Group of companies and will, at all times, treat all personally identifiable information strictly in accordance with The UK General Data Protection Regulations (“UK GDPR”), supported by the Data Protection Act 2018 (“DPA 2018”).</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>How we collect your personal data</h3>
      <p>We usually use direct interaction to collect data from and about you through telephone, email, letter, or face to face communication. We also use online forms and quotation facilities for certain policy types. These may be websites administered by Jensten Group or by a third-party provider on our behalf.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>What information we collect and how we use this information</h3>
      <p>We may collect, use, process, store and transfer different kinds of personal data about you for the purpose of arranging your contract(s) of insurance, that is necessary under the lawful basis of contract.  We may also use this data to arrange premium finance for you at your request.  We do not collect data that we do not need, the data we could collect is categorised as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p><b>Identify data:</b>   Full name, previous names, title, date of birth, gender, NI number, passport number, driving licence number.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Contact data:</b>    Email address, residential address, telephone numbers.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Financial data:</b>  Bank details, payment card details.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Insurance data:</b>  Claims history, occupation.  We may also request special categories of personal information in relation to medical history, any offences, or alleged offences.</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Where we need to collect personal data under the terms of a contract we have with you and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you.  In this case we may have to cancel the insurance that you have in place, and we will notify you if this is the case.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Lawful basis</h3>
      <p>We will ensure data is processed lawfully, fairly and in an open and transparent manner and ensure appropriate security measures are in place against unauthorised or unlawful processing or accidental loss, destruction or damage using appropriate technical or organisational measures (such as restricting access to key people within our organisation for certain aspects of your information; and periodically checking the level of security we apply to prevent unauthorised use, accidental loss, or misuse of your information).</p>
      <p>If you are providing personal data on behalf of a third party, you must provide them with a copy of this privacy notice and obtain any consent where we require it for the processing of their data.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Automated decision making and profiling</h3>
      <p>In certain circumstances such as, our online quote and buy systems, or when a quotation is requested, or changes are made to an existing policy or at each renewal of an insurance arrangement, any or all of our group companies assessment may involve an automated decision to determine whether we are able to provide an insurance arrangement. Individuals can object to us using an automated decision (see the individual rights section) however in those situations it may prevent us from being able to provide you with insurance.</p>
      <p>When processing personal data for profiling purposes, we will ensure appropriate safeguards are in place, ensuring:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Processing is fair and transparent and provides meaningful information about the logic involved; as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences.</li>
        <li>Use appropriate mathematical or statistical procedures for the profiling.</li>
        <li>Appropriate technical and organisational measures are in place to enable inaccuracies to be corrected and minimise the risk of errors.</li>
        <li>Secure your personal data in a way that is proportionate to the risk to your interests and rights and prevents discriminatory.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>For our quotation systems we may use external data from credit agencies, the electoral roll, etc. to help in decision-making on pricing and risk acceptance. This may be regarded as “profiling” as defined in the legislation.</p>
      <p>As explained (a-d above), we have safeguards in place in the event that this has a legal or similarly significant effect on individuals. We do not consider that our processing poses such risks, but you have rights to further information on these processes as explained below.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Marketing</h3>
      <p>When marketing to you as an individual (including individual sole traders and partnerships), we will rely on the lawful basis of either your prior consent or legitimate interest to contact you, such as by phone, email, push notifications, SMS text, or post, to tell you about new products or services we have or are developing which we think may be of interest to you.</p>
      <p>You have the right at any time to stop us from contacting you for marketing purposes and may opt out at any time by contacting the DPO on the details below with your instructions.</p>
      <p>We may also share limited information with specified third parties in order to gain feedback on our service to you, we do this under the basis of legitimate interest. Should we need to use your information for any other purpose we shall request your consent to do so.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Data Controller & Data Processor</h3>
      <p>The contractual arrangements we have in place with our suppliers (e.g., insurance companies, our client database software providers, and similar providers of services to us, including other third-party companies who use our services), are governed by and shall be deemed to operate strictly in accordance with the terms of such contracts.

    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Use & Storage of your Information Overseas</h3>
      <p>We will never knowingly transfer, store, or process information about you or an individual, outside the Europe an Economic Area (EEA).

All reasonable steps shall typically have been undertaken to ensure the firm to which information is being transferred has suitable standards in place to protect such information.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>What we will not do with your information</h3>
      <p>Unless required to do so by law, or for other similar reasons, other than those outlined (see sharing your information) we will never otherwise share personal information without legal basis or without ensuring the appropriate care and necessary safeguards are in place; we will in any other event ask for your consent to share that information and explain the reasons.</p>
    </section>

    <section>

      <p>We will only keep and / or maintain information about an individual for as long as is necessary in providing our products and services, or for compliance with a legal or regulatory obligation, including our legitimate interests or the interests of the controller where we are the processor.</p>
      <p>This means, we will only keep information that is necessary so that we can sufficiently deal with administrative issues, queries, claims and / or for compliance with legal reasons; usually we will keep information for a minimum retention period of 7 years after cessation of a product or service we have provided. For employers’ liability and certain other specific classes of business that require it, we will retain data indefinitely.</p>
